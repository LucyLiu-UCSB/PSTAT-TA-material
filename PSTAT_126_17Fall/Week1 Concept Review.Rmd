# Sampling Distributions

* **Definition:** The random variables $Y_1, Y_2,\ldots , Y_n$ are observed in a random sample selected from a population of interest. Certain functions of $Y_1, Y_2,\ldots , Y_n$ are called statistics. All statistics have probability distributions, which we will call their *sampling distributions*.

* **Example:** If $Y_1, Y_2,\ldots , Y_n$ are from $N(\mu, \sigma^2)$, then sample mean defined as
$$\bar{Y}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nY_i$$
is normally distributed. The *sampling distribution* of $\bar{Y}$ is $N(\mu,\frac{\sigma^2}{n})$.

Based on the sampling distribution of statistics, we can make *statistical inference* on population parameters. Statistical inference includes *hypothesis testing* and *estimation* of the population parameters. Further, estimation includes *point estimation* ($\bar{Y}$ is a point estimation of $\mu$) and *interval estimation* (confidence interval calculation). Therefore, only if we know the sampling distribution of certain statistics, we can use these statistics to develop hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.

# Hypothesis Testing
**Example: **One sample mean test. 

If $X_1,X_2,\ldots,X_n$ come from $N(\mu, \sigma^2)$, where $\sigma^2$ is a known constant. We are going to make inference on $\mu$. Use significance level $\alpha=0.05$.

* Null and alternative hypothesis: the hypothesis to be tested, called the null hypothesis and denoted
by $H_0$. $H_a$ is the hypothesis to be accepted in case $H_0$ is rejected.

$$H_0: \mu=5\quad \text{ v.s. }\quad H_a:\mu\neq5$$

* Test statistic: is a function of the sample measurements ($X_i's$ in our example) on which the statistical decision will be based. In our example, $z-$statistic is 

$$Z=\frac{\bar{X}-\mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}.$$

* Null distribution: the sampling distribution of test statistic under null hypothesis $H_0$. In our example, $Z\sim N(0,1)$.

* P-value: is defined as the probability, under the null hypothesis $H_0$, of obtaining a result equal to or more extreme than what was actually observed. If observed value of $Z$ is $z=2$, then P-value in this example is 
$$\text{P-value}=2\times P(Z>z)=2\times P(Z>2)=0.0455.$$
If P-value is less than $\alpha$, reject null hypothesis. So in this example, we reject $H_0$ because $\text{P-value}=0.0455<\alpha=0.05$.

* Critical value: specifies the values of the test statistic for which the null hypothesis is to be rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis.  
When $\alpha=0.05$, the critical value for two-sided mean test in this example is 1.96 and -1.96. Therefore, if observed $Z$ is 2, we reject null hypothesis. 


# Confidence Intervals

 Confidence intervals are interval estimates of the unknown parameter which can be constructed from point estimates. In our example,  a two-sided confidence
interval for $\mu$ with confidence level $1 âˆ’ \alpha=95\%$ is given by 
$$(\bar{X}-1.96*\sigma/\sqrt{n},\bar{X}+1.96*\sigma/\sqrt{n}).$$


* Confidence level: is the frequency (i.e., the proportion) of possible confidence intervals that contain the true value of their corresponding parameter.
